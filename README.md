# Build a Custom Greeting GitHub Action with Python

## Raw Problem

In this assignment, you are tasked with building a custom GitHub Action using Python to greet users with a personalized message. The exercise will involve creating a Python script, integrating it into a GitHub Actions workflow, and validating its functionality through automated tests. You will also practice updating a credentials file for authentication.

Your GitHub credentials have already been stored, and you will operate within a designated repository for this task.

## Tasks

Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the necessary permissions (repo and workflow).
Update the /home/user/github_creds.json file with your GitHub username and the newly generated access token in the following format:

```
{
     "repository_name": "your_repo_name",
     "access_token": "your_github_personal_access_token",
     "username": "your_github_username
}
```

This file will be used for authentication in the subsequent tasks.

**Task 2:** Create a Python Script
Create a Python script named script.py in the root of your repository.

The script should:
Take the user's name as input.

Output a personalized greeting message.

Example Python code:

```
import sys

def main():
   try:
       # Get the name from the command line arguments
       name = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "GitHub User"
       greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
       print(greeting)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error: {e}")
       exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
```

**Task 3:** Define Workflow Requirements
Create a workflow file under .github/workflows/ and name it greet.yml .

The workflow should meet the following requirements:

**Trigger:** The workflow must trigger on every push to the main branch.

**Environment:** Use ubuntu-latest as the runner environment.

**Steps:**

**Checkout Code:** Use actions/checkout to pull the repository's code.

**Set Up Python:** Use actions/setup-python to set up Python. The version should be configurable (e.g., 3.x).

**Run Python Script:** Execute the script.py file with a custom input, such as "John Doe."

**Output:** The workflow logs must display the greeting message generated by the Python script.

**Task 4**: Validate Workflow Execution
Push your changes to the repository to trigger the workflow.

**Verify the workflow execution:**

Go to the Actions tab in your repository and review the logs.

Confirm that the workflow successfully runs the Python script and outputs the greeting message.

Example log output:

```
Hello, John Doe!
```
